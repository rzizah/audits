## Auditing Stages

### 1. Pre-Audit Phase (~1 day)

In the pre-audit stage, I conduct an initial review of the protocol to assess its structure, complexity, and code characteristics. This process helps to identify basic vulnerabilities, including Degree of decentralization, Code complexity, Access control logic, Review common vulnerabilities (e.g., re-entrancy, unsafe casting).

Then will provide a summary of any issues found and an estimated cost for the audit.

**Note:** This phase is complimentary, and no fee is required until the audit is formally agreed upon. For information on accepted and restricted protocols, see [Protocols Not Accepted](#protocols-not-accepted).

### 2. Audit Phase

Once the quote and terms are accepted, the core audit begins. This comprehensive analysis includes: Detailed code review and line-by-line analysis, Communication with protocol developers to clarify any ambiguous or abnormal code behavior, Documentation of findings, classified by severity, within a dedicated issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues).

#### Deliverables:

A report listing vulnerabilities, each labeled by severity and accompanied by detailed mitigation recommendations.

### 3. Mitigation Review (~1 week)

In the final phase, I work closely with the development team as they address reported issues. This includes: Verifying the effectiveness of fixes without introducing new vulnerabilities, Providing a final assessment and recommendations on the protocol's readiness for deployment.

_Note:_ Any additional development outside the scope of vulnerability fixes may require a separate agreement.

## Pricing and Duration

### Pricing

The cost of an audit depends on two main factors:

1. **Code Size** (measured in Lines of Code, or LOC),
2. **Code Complexity** (e.g., integrations, complex math, YUL code).

**Rate**: Negotiable and is up-to 10 USDC per LOC based on [ConsenSys Solidity Metrics](https://github.com/Consensys/solidity-metrics). Prices vary with complexity.

### Estimated Duration

|LOC Range|Estimated Duration|
|---|---|
|≤ 500 LOC|~4 days|
|500 - 1000 LOC|~7 days|
|1000 - 1500 LOC|~10 days|
|1500 - 2000 LOC|~14 days|

_Note:_ Duration may vary based on specific protocol conditions and requirements.

## Protocols Not Accepted

Certain protocol types will not be accepted for audit due to ethical, legal. These include:

- **Fraud or Deceptive Protocols**: Any protocol designed to mislead or steal funds.
- **Gambling and Lottery Protocols**.
- **Lending/Borrowing Protocols with Interest > 0**.
- **Leverage Protocols**: Including trading and borrowing with leverage.
- **Perpetual or Options Trading**.
